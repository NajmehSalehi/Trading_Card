This is a simple project for practicing HTML and CSS techniques.

How to use the blank files:
------------------------------------------------------

* In This project, I tried to mimic the features that is shown in design-prototype.png file.

* I customized card.html .

* As you see in the complete project, CSS styles are added to the styles.css .

* Border around the animal name, image and it's information (interesting fact, list items, and description) were added. I set the border-style, border-width and border-color as you can see in the completed project.

* Spacing / Padding also applied around the animal's name, image, the list of items and the information.
